## Brief Introduction

This repository hosts the code, data, and model weight of **RLHF-V**, a novel framework that aligns Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) behavior through fine-grained correctional human feedback.

We collect <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/HaoyeZhang/RLHF-V-Dataset">fine-grained correctional feedback data</a>, which can better credit the desired behavior, by asking human annotators to correct the hallucinated segments in model responses. Benefiting from the high data efficiency, it takes only 1 hour on 8 A100 GPUs for us to reduce the hallucination rate of the base model by 34.8%. Specifically, we conduct experiments on [Muffin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00653), an MLLM that has a strong ability in image understanding and reasoning which is trained on [UniMM-Chat](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Yirany/UniMM-Chat/settings).

Visit our üè† [project page](https://rlhf-v.github.io) and üìÉ [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00849) to explore more! And don't miss the to try our interactive üî• [demo](http://120.92.209.146:8081)!

## üéàNews

* [2024.01.06] üî• A **larger, more diverse** set of fine-grained human correction data is available now! üî• The newly released data has about 5.7k of fine-grained human correction data that covers the **output of more powerful models** (Qwen-VL-Chat, InstructBLIP, etc.). We also expand the image types from everyday scenes to **diverse styles and themes** (WikiArt, landmarks, scene texts, etc.).
* [2023.12.15] üóÇ We merge a new subset in our huggingface dataset! It contains an amount of **1,065 fine-grained human preference data** annotated on the outputs of **LLaVA-13B**. 

* [2023.12.04] üìÉ Our paper is accesible at [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00849) now. We are still working hard to improve the data **diversity** and **amount**. More high-qulity data are just on the way!

## Dataset

We present the [RLHF-V-Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HaoyeZhang/RLHF-V-Dataset), which is a human preference dataset constructed by fine-grained segment-level human corrections. In practice, we obtain a total of 1.4k annotated data that includes a diverse set of detailed description instructions and question-answering instructions.


## RLHF-V Weights

We release RLHF-V model weights on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/openbmb/RLHF-V_v0).

We also provide [our SFT weights](https://huggingface.co/Yirany/RLHF-V_v0_SFT), which is the model checkpoint after finetuning Muffin on the VQAv2 dataset.

## Install

1. Install Muffin
```bash
cd RLHF-V
git clone https://github.com/thunlp/muffin

cd Muffin
# Creating conda environment
conda create -n muffin python=3.10
conda activate muffin

# Installing dependencies
pip install -e .

# Install specific version of transformers to make sure you can reproduce the experimental results in our papers
git clone --recursive git@github.com:huggingface/transformers.git
cd transformers
git checkout a92e0ad2e20ef4ce28410b5e05c5d63a5a304e65
pip install .
cd ..
```

2. Prepare training environment

Install additional packages if you need to do training.
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention.git
cd flash-attention

# Note: Uncomment the following line if you have CUDA version <= 11.4
# git checkout ad11394

MAX_JOBS=8 python setup.py install
cd ..
```

3. Prepare evaluation environment

To run Object HalBench evaluation, you also need the following packages:
```bash
jsonlines
nltk==3.8.1
spacy==3.7.0

# Download and install "en_core_web_trf" for spacy
# The wheel version we use can be downloaded from
# https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/tag/en_core_web_trf-3.7.2
# run pip install en_core_web_trf-3.7.2-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Evaluation

### LLaVA Bench

Run the following script to generate, evaluate, and summarize results for LLaVA Bench:

```bash
# cd RLHF-V

bash ./script/eval/eval_muffin_llavabench.sh ./RLHF-V_weight ./results/RLHF-V {YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY}
```

### Object HalBench

1. Prepare COCO2014 annotations

The evaluation of Object HalBench relies on the caption and segmentation annotations from the COCO2014 dataset. Please first download the COCO2014 dataset from the COCO dataset's official website.

```bash
mkdir coco2014
cd coco2014

wget http://images.cocodataset.org/annotations/annotations_trainval2014.zip

unzip annotations_trainval2014.zip
```

2. Inference, evaluation, and summarization

Please replace `{YOUR_COCO2014_ANNOTATION_DIR}` with the path for COCO2014 annotation directory(e.g. `./coco2014/annotations`), and replace `{YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY}` with a valid OpenAI api-key.

```bash
# cd RLHF-V

bash ./script/eval_muffin_objhal.sh ./RLHF-V_weight ./results/RLHF-V {YOUR_COCO2014_ANNOTATION_DIR} {YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY}
```

### MMHal Bench

1. Prepare MMHal Data

Please download the MMHal evaluation data [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mQyAbeGgRyiVV6qjVkUI1uY_g9E-bDTH/view?usp=sharing), and save the file in `eval/data`. 

2. Run the following script to generate, evaluate, and summarize results for MMHal Bench:

```bash
# cd RLHF-V

bash ./script/eval_muffin_mmhal.sh ./RLHF-V_weight ./results/RLHF-V {YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY}
```




## RLHF-V Training

1. Prepare training data

Please download the TSV files for our RLHF-V-Dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iJ9FvI2ENK9xjN1nAFMgyB5zSTTL1BE6?usp=sharing), and save it to the following directory:

```
Muffin/data/RLHF-V-Dataset
```

For training simplicity, we generate the logp values based on [RLHF-V_SFT-13B](https://huggingface.co/Yirany/RLHF-V_v0_SFT/tree/main) model and provide it in our dataset in advance.

To generate logp values on your own, you can run the following script:

```bash
cd Muffin

bash ./script/eval_muffin_inference_logp.sh ./RLHF-V_SFT_weight ./data/RLHF-V-Dataset RLHF-V-Dataset-1401.tsv
```

2. Prepare model checkpoint

Please download our [SFT model checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/Yirany/RLHF-V_v0_SFT/tree/main).

3. Training

After installing the environment of Muffin, you can train your model as follows:
```bash
cd Muffin

bash ./script/train/run_RLHFV.sh ./RLHFV_checkpoints/dpo_exp master RLHFV 5.0 ./RLHF-V_SFT_weight RLHF-V-Dataset 1 320 40 0.5 False True
```
